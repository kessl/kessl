# Hi, my name is Daniel. I make machines do things.

Iâ€™m a software developer by trade. I enjoy creating software people find useful, from scratch to completion.

I'm also interested in hardware hacking, self-propelled flying objects, ecology & permaculture, mountain hiking and woodworking; arbitrarily combined.

See my [blog](https://blog.bitgate.cz/) or find out a bit more [about me](https://blog.bitgate.cz/about).
